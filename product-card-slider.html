                    Tufted wall hangings are not limited to a particular style or
                    theme. Some are bohemian-inspired pieces with fringe and
                    earthy tones, while others are more minimalist designs with
                    clean lines and monochromatic color schemes. This versatility
                    ensures that there's a tufted wall hanging for every taste and
                    interior design preference.
